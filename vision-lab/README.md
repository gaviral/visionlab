# Vision Lab - Robotic Vision Simulation Platform

**Purpose:** Browser-based no-code simulation platform for designing and visualizing robotic vision systems. Built with modern web technologies to demonstrate technical excellence in 3D interfaces, component architecture, and user experience design.

**Vision:** Make robotic vision system design accessible through intuitive browser-based tools, enabling rapid prototyping and visualization without hardware dependencies.

## Key Features

- **No-Code 3D Design**: Intuitive drag-and-place interface for robotic cell layout
- **Real-Time Visualization**: Interactive 3D scene with camera, bin, obstacle, and robot placement
- **Modular Architecture**: Extreme component reusability following SOLID principles
- **Professional-Grade UX**: Smooth animations, intuitive interactions, delightful user experience
- **Performance Optimized**: Selective re-renders, efficient state management, 60fps rendering

## Technical Excellence

This project demonstrates:
- **Innovation**: Novel approach to browser-based robotic simulation
- **Engineering Excellence**: Clean architecture, type safety, comprehensive documentation
- **Ingenuity**: Complex 3D interactions simplified through thoughtful component design
- **Continuous Learning**: Built using latest React patterns, Three.js best practices, and modern web standards
